**X-Gate** is a powerful, high-performance Telegram bot designed to keep your groups clean and spam-free. It enforces strict moderation on X (formerly Twitter) links, ensuring that every shared link adds value to the conversation.

## 🛡️ Key Features

- **智能 Smart Regex**: Accurately detects X/Twitter links, ignoring trailing punctuation.
- **⚡ Rate Limiting**: Limit the number of links a user can post per week to prevent flooding.
- **📝 Context Enforcement**: Require users to add text/commentary with their links (no more naked link spam!).
- **🌍 Timezone Aware**: Built with UTC consistency for reliable usage tracking across the globe.
- **🐋 Docker Ready**: Deploy in seconds with the included Docker configuration.
